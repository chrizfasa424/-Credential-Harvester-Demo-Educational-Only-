# Credential Harvester Demo (Educational Only)

This project simulates a basic **credential harvesting attack** through a fake login form â€” purely for **educational and cybersecurity awareness purposes**. No data is stored or sent. This demo helps learners understand how phishing attacks look and behave at a basic front-end level.

>  **DISCLAIMER**: This tool is intended only for ethical cybersecurity training. Do not use it for malicious purposes.
